### About Me

* * *

        	![](me.jpg)

I am a second year at the University of Edinburgh, studying Computer Science. In my spare time when I am not studying or working as a bartender, I tend to work on my side projects. They allow me to gain further knowledge and to build applications and services that I want to use.

My main interests are artificial intelligence and big data. After being inspired by the movie [Iron Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/?ref_=nv_sr_2), I began working on [Jarvis](https://github.com/DownMoney/Jarvis). It's my oldest side project (about 5 years). The current version uses statistical machine learning to accomplish tasks, such as: named entity recognition, natural language parsing, answer system. It also does some simple tasks like checking the weather or playing a film. While my implementation of Jarvis is not complete, I strongly believe that with the help of modern statistics, big data analysis and further study into artificial intelligence I will be able to complete it.
